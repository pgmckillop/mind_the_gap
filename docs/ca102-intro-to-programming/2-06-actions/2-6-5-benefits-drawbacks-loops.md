# 2.6.5 Benefits and Drawbacks of Loops

---

## Purpose of Loops
**Loops** are used to repeat a set of instructions multiple times.  
They are applied when actions need to be carried out:
- a fixed number of times
- until a condition is met

Loops support efficient and structured program design.

## Benefits of Using Loops

### Reduced Code Duplication
- the same instructions do not need to be written repeatedly
- programs are shorter and easier to maintain

---

### Improved Efficiency
- repetitive tasks are handled automatically
- reduces development time
- simplifies updates and modifications

---

### Improved Readability
- repetition is clearly expressed in a single structure
- program logic is easier to follow

---

### Flexibility
- loops can adapt to different amounts of data
- suitable for processing collections of unknown size

---

## Drawbacks of Using Loops

### Risk of Infinite Loops
- incorrect conditions may cause loops to never terminate
- can result in program freezing or crashing

---

### Increased Complexity
- nested or poorly structured loops can be difficult to understand
- logic errors may be harder to trace

---

### Performance Issues
- unnecessary or inefficient loops can reduce performance
- large numbers of iterations may increase execution time

---

### Debugging Difficulty
- errors inside loops may repeat multiple times
- tracing variable changes can be challenging

---

## Exam Focus
You should be able to:
- explain the benefits of using loops
- explain the drawbacks of using loops
- make judgements about when loops are appropriate to use

!!! tip "Exam tip"
Marks are often awarded for **balancing benefits against drawbacks** when justifying the use of loops.
