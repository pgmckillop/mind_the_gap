# 2.6 Actions

---

## Purpose of Actions
**Actions** control the order in which instructions in a program are executed.  
They determine:
- how tasks are carried out
- how decisions are made
- how repetition is handled

Actions allow programs to respond to different inputs and conditions.

---

## Types of Actions in Scope
The specification defines three core actions:

- **sequence**
- **selection**
- **iteration**

These actions form the basis of program control flow.

---

## Sequence
**Sequence** is the execution of instructions **in a defined order**, one after another.

**Purpose:**
- ensure steps occur in the correct order
- support predictable program behaviour

Sequence is used in all programs and underpins all other actions.

---

## Selection
**Selection** allows a program to **choose between alternative paths** based on a condition.

**Purpose:**
- make decisions
- control which instructions are executed

Selection enables programs to respond differently to different inputs or situations.

---

## Iteration
**Iteration** allows a set of instructions to be **repeated**.

**Purpose:**
- handle repetitive tasks efficiently
- reduce duplication of code

Iteration is used when actions must occur multiple times based on a condition or count.

---

## Using Actions Together
Actions are often combined to:
- control complex program logic
- manage user input and output
- process collections of data

Correct use of actions ensures programs are:
- efficient
- reliable
- easy to understand

---

## Exam Focus
You should be able to:
- Define sequence, selection, and iteration
- Explain the purpose of each action
- Identify how actions control program flow

!!! tip "Exam tip"
Marks are often awarded for **explaining how actions affect the order of execution**, not just naming them.
