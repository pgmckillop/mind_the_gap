## 2.2 Variables and constants

### 2.2.2 Constants
A constant is a named value that is intended to remain unchanged while a program is running.  
The purpose of constants is to store fixed values that are used repeatedly within a program.  
Constants are used when a value must remain the same to ensure consistency and reduce the risk of unintended modification. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

**Benefits**
- improves consistency by preventing accidental changes to fixed values  
- improves readability by giving meaningful names to fixed values  
- simplifies maintenance when fixed values need to be reviewed or updated.

**Drawbacks**
- may reduce flexibility if a value needs to change at runtime  
- inappropriate use may limit reuse in different contexts.

### 2.2.3 Data type conversion functions
Data type conversion functions are used to convert data from one data type to another.  
The purpose of data type conversion is to ensure data is in an appropriate form for processing, calculation or comparison.  
Data type conversion functions are used when data must be changed to a compatible type to allow correct program execution. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

**Benefits**
- enables correct processing of data from different sources  
- reduces errors caused by incompatible data types  
- supports accurate calculations and comparisons.

**Drawbacks**
- inappropriate conversion may lead to loss of precision  
- unnecessary conversion may introduce complexity.

## Exam Focus
You should be able to:
- Define constants and explain their purpose
- Identify when constants should be used
- Explain the purpose of data type conversion functions
- Recognise situations where data type conversion is required
- Compare benefits and drawbacks of using constants and data type conversion

!!! tip "Exam tip"
    Questions may assess knowledge of constants and data type conversion. Responses should clearly distinguish their purposes and justify use based on correctness, consistency and suitability within digital software development.
