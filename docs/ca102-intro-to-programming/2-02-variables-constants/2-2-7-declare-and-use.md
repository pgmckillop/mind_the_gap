# 2.2.7–2.2.9 Variables, Constants, and Type Conversion in Use

---

## 2.2.7 Declaring Variables and Constants

**Declaring** a variable or constant involves:
- assigning a name
- assigning a value
- using an appropriate data type

Declaration makes the data available for use within its scope.

**Key points:**
- variable and constant names should be meaningful
- declared values must match the intended data type
- constants are declared to prevent values from changing

Correct declaration supports clarity and reduces errors.

## 2.2.8 Using Variables and Constants

**Using variables and constants** means accessing their stored values within program statements.

They are used to:
- store intermediate results
- control program logic
- represent values that may change (variables)
- represent fixed values (constants)

Effective use ensures:
- values are reused efficiently
- programs are easier to maintain
- logic is easier to follow

Incorrect use can lead to:
- overwritten values
- logical errors
- unintended behaviour

## 2.2.9 Using Data Type Conversion Functions

**Using data type conversion functions** allows values to be changed to a compatible data type before use.

Conversion is commonly required when:
- input is received as text
- calculations require numeric types
- output must be presented as text
- logical conditions require Boolean values

Correct use of conversion functions:
- ensures compatible operations
- prevents type-related runtime errors
- supports accurate calculations and comparisons

Failure to apply conversion appropriately may result in:
- program crashes
- incorrect outputs
- faulty decision-making

## Exam Focus
You should be able to:
- Declare variables and constants using standard data types
- Use variables and constants correctly within scope
- Apply appropriate data type conversion functions in a given context

!!! tip "Exam tip"
Examiners reward answers that **show why declaration, usage, or conversion is necessary**, not just that it occurs.
