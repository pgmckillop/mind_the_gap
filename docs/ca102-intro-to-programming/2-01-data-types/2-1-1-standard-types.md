# 2.1.1 Standard Data Types

---

## Definition and Purpose
**Standard data types** define the kind of data that can be stored, processed, and manipulated in a program.  
They determine:
- how data is represented in memory
- what operations can be performed on the data
- how data is interpreted by the program

Using appropriate data types ensures programs behave predictably and correctly.

## Common Standard Data Types

### Integer
- Represents **whole numbers**
- Does **not** include decimal places
- Used when values are counted or measured in whole units

**Used when:**
- counting items
- storing quantities
- working with indexes or positions

---

### Float
- Represents **numbers with decimal places**
- Used when precision beyond whole numbers is required

**Used when:**
- storing measurements
- handling calculations involving fractions or averages
- representing continuous values

---

### String
- Represents **textual data**
- Stored as a sequence of characters
- Enclosed in quotation marks in code

**Used when:**
- storing names
- handling user input
- representing messages or labels

---

### Boolean
- Represents **logical values**
- Can only have two possible values:
  - `True`
  - `False`

**Used when:**
- controlling program flow
- evaluating conditions
- storing yes/no or on/off states

---

## Choosing the Correct Data Type
The data type selected should match:
- the **nature of the data**
- the **operations required**
- the **expected outputs**

Incorrect data type selection can lead to:
- calculation errors
- incorrect comparisons
- unexpected program behaviour

---

## Exam Focus
You should be able to:
- Define each standard data type
- Identify when each data type should be used
- Select an appropriate data type for a given scenario

!!! tip "Exam tip"
Marks are often awarded for **matching the data type to the nature of the data**, not just naming the data type.
