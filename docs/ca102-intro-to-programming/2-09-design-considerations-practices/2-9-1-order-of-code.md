# 2.9.1–2.9.4 Order of Code

---

## Purpose of Ordering Code
The **order of code** determines how instructions are executed and how data is processed.  
Correct ordering is essential to:
- produce accurate outputs
- avoid logical errors
- ensure efficient execution

---

## 2.9.1 Logical Order for Actions Within Processes

Actions within a process must be arranged so that:
- required data is available before it is used
- steps follow a clear and logical sequence
- outcomes are predictable

**Key considerations:**
- inputs must be obtained before processing
- processing must occur before output
- dependent actions must occur after prerequisite actions

---

## 2.9.2 Order of Operations in Calculations and Processes

The **order of operations** affects calculation results and program behaviour.

Correct ordering is required:
- to ensure outputs are accurate
- to prevent unintended results

**Key considerations:**
- calculations must follow the correct mathematical order
- intermediate results may need to be stored
- operations must occur in the intended sequence

Incorrect ordering can lead to:
- incorrect calculations
- logical errors
- unexpected outputs

---

## 2.9.3 Order of Selecting Data Structures

The selection of data structures must occur with consideration for:
- efficiency of execution time
- efficient use of memory

**Key considerations:**
- data structures should support the required operations
- inappropriate structures can slow execution
- unnecessary complexity can waste memory

Correct ordering ensures:
- data is stored before it is accessed
- structures are chosen before processing begins

---

## 2.9.4 Order of Actions for Efficiency

Actions should be ordered to:
- minimise execution time
- reduce unnecessary memory use

**Key considerations:**
- avoid repeated or redundant actions
- perform simple checks before complex operations
- structure processes to reduce processing overhead

Efficient ordering improves:
- program performance
- scalability
- maintainability

---

## Exam Focus
You should be able to:
- determine the correct logical order of actions
- explain why order of operations affects accuracy
- make judgements about ordering actions and data structures for efficiency

!!! tip "Exam tip"
Marks are often awarded for **explaining why a specific order is required**, not just stating the order itself.
