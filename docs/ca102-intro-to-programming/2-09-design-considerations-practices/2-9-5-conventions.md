# 2.9.5–2.9.6 Naming and Code Style Conventions

---

## Purpose of Conventions
**Conventions** are agreed rules and guidelines used when writing code.  
They improve:
- readability
- consistency
- maintainability

Following conventions makes code easier to understand and work with.

---

## 2.9.5 Naming Conventions

### Meaningful Names
- names should describe the purpose of the variable, constant, function, or procedure
- improves clarity and understanding

---

### camelCase
- first word starts with a lowercase letter
- each subsequent word starts with a capital letter

**Used for:**
- identifiers where this convention is adopted by the project or language

---

### snake_case
- all letters are lowercase
- words are separated by underscores

**Used for:**
- identifiers where readability is prioritised
- common in Python-based code

---

## Purpose of Naming Conventions
Naming conventions:
- make code self-explanatory
- reduce ambiguity
- support collaboration between developers

Poor naming can lead to:
- misunderstanding
- incorrect usage
- increased maintenance effort

---

## 2.9.6 Code Style and Readability

### Use of White Space
- spaces and blank lines separate logical sections of code
- improves visual clarity

---

### Maximum Line Length
- lines should be kept to a manageable length
- prevents horizontal scrolling
- improves readability across devices

---

## Impact on Readability
Code style conventions affect:
- ease of reading
- speed of understanding
- likelihood of errors

Consistent application:
- reduces cognitive load
- supports debugging and review

---

## Exam Focus
You should be able to:
- identify naming conventions used in code
- explain the purpose of naming and style conventions
- explain how conventions impact readability

!!! tip "Exam tip"
Marks are often awarded for **linking conventions to readability and maintainability**, not just naming the convention.
