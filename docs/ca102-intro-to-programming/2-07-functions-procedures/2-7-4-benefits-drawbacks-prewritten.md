# 2.7.4 Benefits and Drawbacks of Using Pre-written Code

---

## Purpose
**Pre-written code** refers to functions and procedures that are already available for use rather than being written from scratch.  
These may be built-in, supplied in libraries, or provided by third parties.

---

## Benefits of Using Pre-written Code

### Reduced Development Time
- common functionality does not need to be rewritten
- speeds up program development

---

### Reliability
- code is often well-tested
- reduces the likelihood of errors in standard operations

---

### Consistency
- standardised behaviour across programs
- predictable outputs and usage

---

### Improved Maintainability
- updates and fixes may be provided by the code author
- reduces long-term maintenance effort

---

## Drawbacks of Using Pre-written Code

### Limited Control
- internal implementation cannot easily be changed
- behaviour may not fully match specific requirements

---

### Dependency Risks
- reliance on external code or libraries
- updates or removal of support can impact the program

---

### Performance Overhead
- pre-written code may include unnecessary functionality
- may be less efficient than a custom solution for a specific task

---

### Understanding and Debugging
- developers may not fully understand how the code works internally
- debugging issues can be more difficult

---

## Exam Focus
You should be able to:
- explain the benefits of using pre-written code
- explain the drawbacks of using pre-written code
- make judgements about when pre-written code is appropriate to use

!!! tip "Exam tip"
Marks are often awarded for **balancing time, reliability, and control** when justifying the use of pre-written code.
