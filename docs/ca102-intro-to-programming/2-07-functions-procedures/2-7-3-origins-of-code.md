# 2.7.3 Origins of Functions and Procedures

---

## Purpose
Functions and procedures can originate from different sources.  
Understanding their origins helps determine:
- how they are used
- who is responsible for their correctness
- the level of control over their behaviour

---

## User-Written
Functions and procedures created by the programmer.

**Characteristics:**
- written specifically for the program
- tailored to the problem being solved
- fully controlled and modified by the developer

**Purpose:**
- implement custom logic
- solve problem-specific tasks

---

## Pre-written and Built-in (Programming Language)
Functions and procedures provided as part of the programming language itself.

**Characteristics:**
- always available without additional setup
- designed for common operations
- consistent and well-tested

**Purpose:**
- perform standard tasks
- reduce the need to write common functionality

---

## Pre-written and Supplied in Libraries (Programming Language)
Functions and procedures included in libraries that are part of the language.

**Characteristics:**
- must be accessed through the appropriate library
- extend the capabilities of the language
- maintained by the language developers

**Purpose:**
- provide specialised or extended functionality
- support more complex operations

---

## Pre-written and Supplied in Third-Party Libraries
Functions and procedures created by external developers.

**Characteristics:**
- supplied outside the core language
- may require installation or import
- quality and reliability can vary

**Purpose:**
- add functionality not provided by the language
- speed up development by reusing existing solutions

---

## Exam Focus
You should be able to:
- identify the different origins of functions and procedures
- explain the purpose of each origin
- distinguish between built-in, library-based, and third-party code

!!! tip "Exam tip"
Marks are often awarded for **clearly identifying the source of the code**, not just stating that it is pre-written.
