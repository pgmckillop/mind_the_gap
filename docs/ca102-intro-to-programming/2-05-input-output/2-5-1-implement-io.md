## 2.5 Input and output

### 2.5.1 Implementing input and output
Input and output are used to allow data to enter a program and to present results produced by a program.  
Implementation of input and output determines how data is received, processed and communicated.

- **Keyboard input**  
  Keyboard input allows data to be entered directly by a user during program execution.  
  **Purpose:** to capture user-provided data for processing.  
  **Benefits:**  
  - enables dynamic and interactive data entry  
  - allows programs to respond to user input  
  **Drawbacks:**  
  - relies on correct user input  
  - may require validation to prevent errors.

- **Screen output**  
  Screen output displays information to the user during or after processing.  
  **Purpose:** to present results, messages or feedback generated by a program.  
  **Benefits:**  
  - provides immediate feedback to the user  
  - supports communication of results and program status  
  **Drawbacks:**  
  - limited to what can be displayed visually  
  - not suitable for permanent data storage.

- **Text file input and output**  
  Text file input and output allow data to be read from or written to files stored on secondary storage.  
  **Purpose:** to enable persistent storage and retrieval of data.  
  **Benefits:**  
  - supports long-term data storage  
  - allows data to be reused across multiple program executions  
  **Drawbacks:**  
  - requires file handling operations  
  - dependent on file availability and access permissions.

## Exam Focus
You should be able to:
- Explain how input and output are implemented
- Distinguish between keyboard, screen and text file input/output
- Explain the purpose of each input and output method
- Compare benefits and drawbacks of different input and output methods
- Justify the suitability of an input or output method for a given context

!!! tip "Exam tip"
    Questions may require comparison or justification of input and output methods. Responses should focus on purpose, benefits and drawbacks, and justify suitability in relation to interaction, persistence and communication of data.
