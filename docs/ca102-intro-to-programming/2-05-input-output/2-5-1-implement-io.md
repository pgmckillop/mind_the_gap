# 2.5.1 Implementing Input and Output

---

## Purpose of Input and Output
**Input and output (I/O)** allow a program to:
- receive data for processing
- present results to users
- exchange data with external storage

Input provides data **into** a program.  
Output presents data **from** a program.

---

## Keyboard Input
Keyboard input allows users to **enter data at runtime**.

**Purpose:**
- capture user-provided values
- allow programs to respond dynamically

```python
user_name = input("Enter your name: ")
