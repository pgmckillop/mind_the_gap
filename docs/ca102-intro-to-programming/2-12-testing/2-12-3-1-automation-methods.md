# 2.12.3.1 Purpose of Automation Methods and When They Are Used

---

## Purpose of Automation Methods
**Automation methods** are used to perform testing tasks automatically rather than manually.  
They help to:
- reduce repetitive manual effort
- increase consistency of test execution
- improve efficiency and reliability of testing

Automation is particularly valuable when tests must be run frequently or at scale.

---

## Macros

### Purpose
**Macros** automate a sequence of predefined actions.

### Used When
- the same steps are repeated regularly
- simple, predictable interactions are required
- rapid execution of routine tasks is needed

### Key Characteristics
- record and replay actions
- limited flexibility
- suitable for straightforward processes

---

## Scripts

### Purpose
**Scripts** automate testing actions using written code.

### Used When
- tests require logic or conditions
- repeated tests must adapt to different data
- greater control and flexibility are needed

### Key Characteristics
- programmable and customisable
- reusable across test runs
- require technical knowledge to create and maintain

---

## Functional Testing Tools

### Purpose
**Functional testing tools** automate the testing of system functionality against requirements.

### Used When
- verifying that features work as intended
- testing complete user workflows
- repeated regression testing is required

### Key Characteristics
- simulate user interactions
- validate outputs against expected results
- suitable for large or complex systems

---

## Choosing an Automation Method
The choice of automation method depends on:
- complexity of the test
- frequency of execution
- available skills and resources

Simple tasks suit macros, while complex and repeatable tests benefit from scripts or functional testing tools.

---

## Exam Focus
You should be able to:
- explain the purpose of automation methods
- identify when macros, scripts, and functional testing tools are used
- justify the choice of an automation method in a given scenario

!!! tip "Exam tip"
Marks are often awarded for **linking the automation method to efficiency, consistency, and frequency of testing**, not just naming the method.
