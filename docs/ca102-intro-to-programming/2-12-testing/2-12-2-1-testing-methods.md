# 2.12.2.1 Testing Methods

---

## Purpose of Testing Methods
**Testing methods** are systematic approaches used to check that a solution works as intended.  
They help to:
- identify defects
- verify requirements are met
- reduce risk before deployment

Each method has a specific purpose, with benefits and drawbacks, and is used at different stages of development.

## Concept Testing
**Purpose:**  
- validate ideas or approaches before development begins

**Used when:**  
- exploring feasibility
- assessing early designs

**Benefits:**  
- low cost
- identifies issues early

**Drawbacks:**  
- does not test actual code
- limited technical validation

---

## Unit Testing
**Purpose:**  
- test individual components in isolation

**Used when:**  
- code modules are completed

**Benefits:**  
- defects are easier to locate
- supports modular development

**Drawbacks:**  
- does not test interactions between components

---

## Boundary Testing
**Purpose:**  
- test values at the edges of acceptable input ranges

**Used when:**  
- validation rules exist

**Benefits:**  
- effective at finding edge-case errors

**Drawbacks:**  
- does not test normal-range behaviour fully

---

## Integration Testing
**Purpose:**  
- test how components work together

**Used when:**  
- individual components are combined

**Benefits:**  
- identifies interface and interaction issues

**Drawbacks:**  
- harder to isolate the source of defects

---

## Performance Testing
**Purpose:**  
- measure speed, responsiveness, and stability

**Used when:**  
- performance requirements must be met

**Benefits:**  
- ide
