# 2.3 Data Structures

---

## Purpose of Data Structures
**Data structures** are ways of organising and storing data so it can be accessed, processed, and managed efficiently.  
They support:
- grouping related data
- efficient retrieval and updating of values
- clearer program structure

Selecting an appropriate data structure affects performance, readability, and maintainability.

## 2.3.1 Standard Data Structures

### List
- An **ordered collection** of values
- Elements are accessed by position
- Can store multiple values in a single structure

**Used when:**
- storing a sequence of related items
- order matters
- values may change during execution

---

### Array
- An **indexed collection** of values of the same data type
- Elements are accessed using an index
- Fixed structure once created

**Used when:**
- storing large collections of similar values
- predictable structure is required
- efficient indexed access is important

---

### Dictionary
- A collection of **key–value pairs**
- Each key is unique
- Values are accessed using keys rather than positions

**Used when:**
- values must be retrieved using identifiers
- relationships between data items are required
- fast lookup by key is needed

## 2.3.2 Interpreting Code Using Data Structures
Interpreting code using data structures involves:
- identifying the structure being used
- understanding how values are stored
- tracing how data is accessed and modified

This requires recognising:
- indexes in lists and arrays
- keys and values in dictionaries
- how data flows through the structure

---

## 2.3.3 Developing Code Using Data Structures
Developing code using data structures involves:
- selecting an appropriate structure for the task
- storing data correctly within the structure
- accessing and updating values as required

Correct development ensures:
- efficient data handling
- clear program logic
- reduced duplication of data

---

## 2.3.4 Debugging Code Using Data Structures
Debugging code using data structures involves identifying and correcting errors related to:
- incorrect indexing
- invalid keys
- unexpected data values
- misuse of the data structure

Effective debugging:
- ensures data is stored and retrieved correctly
- prevents runtime errors
- improves reliability of the solution

---

## Choosing the Appropriate Data Structure
The choice of data structure depends on:
- type of data being stored
- how the data will be accessed
- efficiency requirements
- clarity and maintainability of the solution

---

## Exam Focus
You should be able to:
- Define list, array, and dictionary data structures
- Identify when each data structure should be used
- Interpret, develop, and debug code that uses data structures

!!! tip "Exam tip"
Marks are often awarded for **linking the chosen data structure to how the data is accessed or organised**, not just naming it.
