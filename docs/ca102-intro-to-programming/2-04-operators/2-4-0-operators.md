# 2.4 Operators

---

## Purpose of Operators
**Operators** are symbols used to perform operations on data values.  
They enable programs to:
- carry out calculations
- compare values
- evaluate conditions
- control program logic

Using appropriate operators ensures correct processing and decision-making.

## 2.4.1 Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators perform **mathematical calculations** on numeric data.

### In Scope
- **add**
- **subtract**
- **divide**
- **multiply**
- **exponentiation**
- **integer division**
- **modulus**

**Used when:**
- performing calculations
- manipulating numeric values
- producing calculated outputs

**Considerations:**
- division may produce decimal values
- integer division removes the remainder
- modulus returns the remainder of a division

---

## 2.4.2 Relational Operators

Relational operators are used to **compare two values**.

### In Scope
- **equivalence**
- **less than**
- **greater than**
- **not equal**
- **less than or equal to**
- **greater than or equal to**

**Purpose:**
- evaluate conditions
- support decision-making
- return Boolean results (`True` or `False`)

---

## 2.4.3 Boolean Operators

Boolean operators are used to **combine or modify logical expressions**.

### In Scope
- **not**
- **and**
- **or**

**Purpose:**
- control complex decision logic
- combine multiple conditions
- reverse logical outcomes

## 2.4.4 Using Operators

Using operators correctly involves:
- selecting the appropriate operator type
- ensuring compatible data types
- applying operators in the correct logical context

Correct use:
- ensures accurate calculations
- supports reliable decision-making
- prevents logical errors

---

## 2.4.5 Interpreting Code Using Operators

Interpreting code using operators involves:
- identifying the operator used
- understanding the operation being performed
- determining the resulting value or condition

This includes tracing:
- calculation steps
- comparison outcomes
- logical evaluations

---

## 2.4.6 Creating Code Using Operators

Creating code using operators requires:
- selecting suitable arithmetic, relational, or Boolean operators
- applying operators to appropriate data types
- structuring expressions logically

Effective creation ensures:
- clear intent
- correct outcomes
- maintainable code

---

## 2.4.7 Debugging Code Using Operators

Debugging code using operators involves identifying issues such as:
- incorrect operator selection
- incompatible data types
- incorrect logic in compound conditions

Effective debugging:
- corrects calculation errors
- resolves faulty comparisons
- improves program reliability

---

## Exam Focus
You should be able to:
- Identify arithmetic, relational, and Boolean operators
- Explain the purpose of each operator type
- Interpret, create, and debug code that uses operators

!!! tip "Exam tip"
Marks are often awarded for **explaining what an operator does to the data**, not just naming the operator.
