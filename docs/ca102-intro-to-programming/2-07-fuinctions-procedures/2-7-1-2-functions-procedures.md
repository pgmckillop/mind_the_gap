# 2.7.1–2.7.2 Functions and Procedures

---

## Purpose of Functions and Procedures
**Functions** and **procedures** are reusable blocks of code used to organise programs into manageable sections.  
They support:
- modular program design
- code reuse
- improved readability and maintainability

## 2.7.1 Functions

### Characteristics of Functions
A **function**:
- may or may not take parameters
- **must return a result** to the part of the program that called it

---

### Purpose of Functions
Functions are used when:
- a calculation or process produces a value
- a result must be reused elsewhere in the program
- a clear input–output relationship is required

Functions help separate processing logic from program flow.

## 2.7.2 Procedures

### Characteristics of Procedures
A **procedure**:
- may or may not take parameters
- **must not return a result**

---

### Purpose of Procedures
Procedures are used when:
- actions need to be carried out without producing a result
- tasks involve output, updates, or control actions
- structure and clarity are required

Procedures are often used to group related actions.

## Comparison of Functions and Procedures

| Feature        | Function              | Procedure            |
|---------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
| Takes parameters | Yes or No            | Yes or No            |
| Returns a value | Yes (must return)    | No (must not return) |
| Typical use     | Calculations, logic  | Actions, processes   |

## Exam Focus
You should be able to:
- identify the characteristics of functions and procedures
- explain the purpose of functions and procedures
- distinguish between when a function or procedure should be used

!!! tip "Exam tip"
Marks are often awarded for **clearly distinguishing return behaviour**, not just naming functions or procedures.
