# 1.3.5 High-Level Problem-Solving Strategy

---

## What Is a High-Level Problem-Solving Strategy?
A **high-level problem-solving strategy** is a structured approach used to analyse a problem, develop a solution, and review the outcome.

It provides a **logical sequence of stages** that can be applied to a wide range of digital and organisational problems.

---

## Purpose of a High-Level Strategy
A high-level strategy is used to:
- Ensure problems are approached systematically
- Reduce the risk of missing key steps
- Improve the quality and reliability of solutions
- Support clear communication and documentation

---

## Typical Stages of a High-Level Strategy

### 1. Define the Problem
- Clearly state what the problem is
- Identify constraints and requirements
- Avoid assumptions

---

### 2. Gather Information
- Collect relevant data and evidence
- Identify stakeholders
- Understand the context of the problem

---

### 3. Analyse the Problem
- Identify causes and contributing factors
- Break the problem into manageable parts
- Consider risks and dependencies

---

### 4. Plan a Solution
- Identify possible solutions
- Evaluate options
- Select the most suitable approach

---

### 5. Implement the Solution
- Put the planned solution into action
- Follow agreed processes
- Monitor progress during implementation

---

### 6. Review the Outcome
- Check whether the solution meets requirements
- Identify any remaining issues
- Consider improvements or refinements

---

## Why Review Is Important
Reviewing ensures:
- The problem has been fully resolved
- Lessons are learned for future situations
- Continuous improvement is supported

---

## Exam Focus
You should be able to:
- Describe the stages of a high-level problem-solving strategy
- Apply the strategy to a given scenario
- Explain why each stage is important

!!! tip "Exam tip"
Higher-mark questions often reward answers that **link each stage logically to the next**, rather than listing them in isolation.
