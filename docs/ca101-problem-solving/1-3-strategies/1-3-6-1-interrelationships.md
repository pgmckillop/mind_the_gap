# 1.3.6 Interrelationships Between Problems and Problem-Solving Strategies

---

## What This Topic Is About
This section focuses on understanding:
- How **different types of problems** relate to **different problem-solving strategies**
- Why **no single strategy fits every problem**
- How to **judge the suitability** of a strategy in a given digital software development context

This topic is strongly **evaluative**.

## Interrelationships Between Problems and Strategies

Different problems have different characteristics, such as:
- Complexity
- Risk
- Impact
- Time pressure
- Number of possible causes
- Predictability of outcomes

Problem-solving strategies are chosen **based on these characteristics**.

---

## Matching Problems to Strategies

### Simple, Well-Defined Problems
**Characteristics**
- Clear cause-and-effect
- Limited impact
- Few variables

**Most suitable strategy**
- **Five Whys**

**Why**
- Quick to apply
- Efficient for straightforward issues

---

### Complex or High-Risk Problems
**Characteristics**
- Multiple possible failures
- Technical complexity
- Serious consequences if unresolved

**Most suitable strategy**
- **Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA)**

**Why**
- Identifies potential failures in advance
- Reduces risk before implementation

---

### Problems Involving Possible Outcomes or Consequences
**Characteristics**
- Uncertain future events
- Multiple possible paths
- Need for contingency planning

**Most suitable strategy**
- **Event Tree Analysis (ETA)**

**Why**
- Explores different outcomes
- Supports risk and resilience planning

---

## Making Judgements About Suitability

When judging which strategy to use, consider:
- **Nature of the problem** (simple vs complex)
- **Impact** on users or systems
- **Risk level**
- **Time and resources available**
- **Stage of development** (design, implementation, maintenance)

There may be **more than one valid strategy**, but one may be *more suitable* than others.

---

## Example Judgement
**Problem:** Users are intermittently unable to log in.

- Five Whys may identify a simple configuration issue  
- FMEA may be more suitable if failures could affect security  
- ETA may be used if analysing outcomes of authentication failure  

The *most suitable strategy* depends on:
- system criticality
- potential consequences
- recurrence of the issue

## Evaluation Focus
You should be able to:
- Explain how problem characteristics influence strategy choice
- Compare problem-solving strategies
- Justify why one strategy is more suitable than another
- Recognise limitations of inappropriate strategy selection

---

## Exam Focus
Questions may ask you to:
- **Explain** the relationship between a problem and a strategy
- **Describe** how strategies differ
- **Evaluate** which strategy is most suitable in a scenario

!!! tip "Exam tip"
Evaluation answers should:
- Refer to the **problem characteristics**
- Refer to the **strategy’s strengths and limitations**
- Clearly justify **why it is suitable or unsuitable**
