# 1.3.3–1.3.6 Problem-Solving Strategies

## 1.3.3 Root Cause Analysis
**Root cause analysis** is used to identify the underlying cause of a problem, not just its symptoms.

**Purpose**
- Prevents recurring issues
- Supports effective and long-term solutions
- Improves system reliability

Root cause analysis focuses on *why* a problem occurred.

## 1.3.4 Root Cause Analysis Techniques

You should know and understand the purpose of the following techniques:

### Five Whys
- Repeatedly ask *“Why?”* until the root cause is identified
- Simple and quick to apply
- Best suited to straightforward problems

### Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA)
- Identifies:
  - possible failures
  - their causes
  - their effects
- Used to assess **risk** and **impact**
- Common in safety-critical systems

### Event Tree Analysis
- Starts with an initiating event
- Explores possible outcomes based on different paths
- Often used for risk assessment and contingency planning

## 1.3.5 High-Level Problem-Solving Strategy
A **high-level strategy** provides a structured approach to solving problems.

Typical stages include:
1. **Define the problem**
2. **Gather information**
3. **Analyse the problem**
4. **Plan a solution**
5. **Implement the solution**
6. **Review the outcome**

This strategy supports logical, repeatable problem solving.

## 1.3.6 Post-Analysis Actions
After analysing and addressing a problem, actions may include:

- **Logging** the issue and resolution
- **Closing** the issue if resolved
- **Escalating** the issue if it cannot be resolved at the current level

These actions support:
- Accountability
- Continuous improvement
- Organisational learning

## Exam Focus
You should be able to:
- Explain what root cause analysis is
- Identify suitable root cause analysis techniques
- Describe a high-level problem-solving strategy
- Explain why post-analysis actions are important

!!! tip "Exam tip"
If a question mentions **repeated problems** or **long-term fixes**, root cause analysis is usually the most appropriate approach.
