## 1.1 Computational thinking

### 1.1.6 Purpose of decomposition
Decomposition is the process of breaking down a problem or solution into smaller, more manageable parts.  
The purpose of decomposition is to simplify complex problems and solutions so they can be analysed, designed and developed effectively within digital software development. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

### 1.1.7 Tasks of decomposition
The tasks of decomposition are to:
- identify the main features of a problem
- characterise each identified feature
- break problems down into smaller, more manageable parts
- break solutions down into smaller, more manageable parts. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

### 1.1.8 Use of decomposition for problem solving
Decomposition is used for problem solving to:
- analyse complex problems by separating them into component parts
- support the development of solutions by addressing each part individually. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## Exam Focus
You should be able to:
- Explain the purpose of decomposition
- Identify decomposition tasks in a scenario
- Recognise different representation methods
- Interpret an **Information Flow Diagram**
- Explain why an Information Flow Diagram is suitable for a given context

!!! tip "Exam tip"
    Questions may require identification of decomposition tasks or justification of decomposition as an appropriate approach. Responses should link the use of decomposition to managing complexity in digital software development.
