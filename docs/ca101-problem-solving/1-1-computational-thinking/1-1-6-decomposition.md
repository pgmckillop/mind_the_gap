# 1.1.6–1.1.10 Decomposition  
*with emphasis on Information Flow Diagrams*

---

## 1.1.6 Purpose of Decomposition
**Decomposition** is the process of breaking a complex problem or solution into smaller, manageable parts.

**Why decomposition is used**
- Reduces complexity
- Makes problems easier to understand
- Allows parts to be solved, tested, and improved independently
- Supports teamwork and parallel development

---

## 1.1.7 Tasks of Decomposition
When decomposing a problem, you should be able to:
- Identify the **main features** of the problem
- **Characterise** each feature (what it does, inputs/outputs)
- Break the **problem** into smaller parts
- Break the **solution** into smaller parts

These tasks apply to both:
- Understanding an existing system
- Designing a new digital solution

---

## 1.1.8 Using Decomposition for Problem Solving
Decomposition is used to:
- Turn a large problem into a sequence of smaller steps
- Identify reusable components
- Support clearer planning and design

**Exam focus**
- Applying decomposition to a given scenario
- Explaining *why* decomposition improves the solution

---

## 1.1.9 Methods to Represent Decomposition
Decomposition can be represented using:

- **Block diagrams**
- **Information Flow Diagrams**
- **Flowcharts**
- **Code**
- **Written descriptions**

Each method shows *how parts of a system relate to each other*, not just the final outcome.

---

## 1.1.10 Using Methods to Represent Decomposition

You must be able to **interpret and use** these representations appropriately.

## ⭐ Information Flow Diagrams (Key Focus)

### What is an Information Flow Diagram?
An **Information Flow Diagram (IFD)** shows:
- How data moves through a system
- Inputs, processes, data stores, and outputs
- The *flow of information* rather than program logic

---

### Key Features
- **Inputs** – where data enters the system  
- **Processes** – what happens to the data  
- **Data flows** – arrows showing movement of data  
- **Outputs** – where data leaves the system  

IFDs focus on **data movement**, not decision logic.

---

### What Information Flow Diagrams Are Used For
- Understanding how a system handles data
- Showing relationships between system components
- Supporting system analysis and early design stages

---

### Information Flow Diagrams vs Flowcharts

| Information Flow Diagrams | Flowcharts |
|---------------------------|------------|
| Show data movement        | Show control logic |
| Focus on inputs/outputs   | Focus on decisions and sequence |
| Used in system analysis   | Used in algorithm design |

---

## Exam Focus
You should be able to:
- Explain the purpose of decomposition
- Identify decomposition tasks in a scenario
- Recognise different representation methods
- Interpret an **Information Flow Diagram**
- Explain why an Information Flow Diagram is suitable for a given context

!!! tip "Exam tip"
If the question is about **data movement**, an **Information Flow Diagram** is usually the most appropriate representation.
