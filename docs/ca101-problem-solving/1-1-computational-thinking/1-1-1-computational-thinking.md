# 1.1.1 Computational Thinking

## Definition
**Computational thinking** is a problem-solving approach that involves breaking down problems and developing solutions that can be executed by a computer or followed logically by a human.

---

## Purpose of Computational Thinking
Computational thinking is used to:
- Solve complex problems in a structured way
- Design efficient and repeatable solutions
- Support the development of digital systems and software
- Reduce errors by using logical, step-by-step processes

---

## When Computational Thinking Is Used
Computational thinking is applied when:
- A problem can be broken into smaller parts
- A process needs to be automated or repeated
- Data needs to be analysed or processed
- A clear, logical solution is required

---

## Core Components (Overview)
Computational thinking consists of four components:
- **Decomposition** – breaking a problem into manageable parts
- **Pattern recognition** – identifying similarities and trends
- **Abstraction** – focusing on relevant information only
- **Algorithmic design** – creating step-by-step solutions

*(These components are explored in more detail in later sections.)*

---

## Benefits
- Makes complex problems easier to manage
- Encourages logical and structured thinking
- Improves efficiency and accuracy
- Supports collaboration and communication of ideas

---

## Drawbacks / Limitations
- Not suitable for problems requiring creativity or subjective judgement
- Over-simplification can remove important context
- Requires time and skill to apply effectively

---

## Exam Focus
You should be able to:
- Define computational thinking
- Explain why it is used
- Identify situations where it is appropriate
- Recognise its benefits and drawbacks

!!! tip "Exam tip"
Be prepared to **apply computational thinking to a scenario**, not just define it.
