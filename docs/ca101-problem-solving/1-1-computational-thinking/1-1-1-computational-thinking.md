## 1.1 Computational thinking

### 1.1.1 Definition and purpose of computational thinking
Computational thinking is an approach to problem solving that involves analysing problems and solutions so that they can be represented as systems, processes, relationships, organisations of data or code.  
The purpose of computational thinking is to support the development of solutions in digital software development. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

### 1.1.2 When to use computational thinking
Computational thinking is used when:
- analysing digital software development problems
- identifying solutions that can be represented as systems, processes, relationships, organisations of data or code
- developing complete solutions or sub-parts of solutions. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

### 1.1.3 Benefits and drawbacks of computational thinking
**Benefits**
- supports structured analysis of problems
- enables problems and solutions to be represented in forms suitable for digital software development

**Drawbacks**
- may introduce additional complexity
- may not be appropriate for all problems. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

### 1.1.4 Components of computational thinking
Computational thinking consists of:
- decomposition
- pattern recognition
- abstraction
- algorithmic design. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

### 1.1.5 Benefits and drawbacks of using the components of computational thinking
**Benefits**
- enable problems and solutions to be structured and managed
- support the development of logical and organised solutions

**Drawbacks**
- inappropriate application may reduce effectiveness
- misuse may affect the suitability of the resulting solution. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

!!! tip "Exam tip"
    Responses must demonstrate knowledge of computational thinking, its components, and associated benefits and drawbacks. Where judgement is required, suitability must be justified in relation to the problem being addressed.
