### 1.1.9 Methods to represent decomposition

Decomposition can be represented using the following methods. Each method provides a distinct way to show how a problem or solution is broken down into smaller parts and to support understanding of structure and relationships.

- **Block diagrams**  
  Use blocks to represent major components or parts of a problem or solution and the relationships between them.  
  **Purpose:** to provide a high-level structural overview.  
  **Benefits:**  
  - supports clear visualisation of overall structure  
  - reduces complexity by focusing on main components  
  **Drawbacks:**  
  - limited detail of internal processes  
  - not suited to representing logic or data flow.

- **Information flow diagrams**  
  Show how data moves between inputs, processes and outputs.  
  **Purpose:** to represent how information flows through a system and between decomposed parts.  
  **Benefits:**  
  - clarifies relationships between data, processes and outputs  
  - supports understanding of system interactions  
  **Drawbacks:**  
  - does not show detailed processing logic  
  - may become complex for large systems.

- **Flowcharts**  
  Use standard symbols to represent processes, decisions and flow of control.  
  **Purpose:** to visualise the sequence and structure of steps within decomposed parts.  
  **Benefits:**  
  - clearly represents logical flow and decision points  
  - supports step-by-step analysis  
  **Drawbacks:**  
  - can become lengthy or complex  
  - less effective for high-level structure.

- **Code**  
  Represents decomposition through structured instructions and organised sections.  
  **Purpose:** to show how a problem or solution is broken down into executable parts.  
  **Benefits:**  
  - precise and unambiguous  
  - directly implementable  
  **Drawbacks:**  
  - requires programming knowledge  
  - less accessible for non-technical audiences.

- **Written descriptions**  
  Use structured text to describe the parts of a problem or solution and their relationships.  
  **Purpose:** to explain decomposition clearly using language.  
  **Benefits:**  
  - flexible and accessible  
  - useful for outlining structure and intent  
  **Drawbacks:**  
  - may lack precision  
  - harder to visualise complex relationships.

## Exam Focus
You should be able to:
- Identify methods used to represent decomposition
- Explain the purpose of each representation method
- Compare benefits and drawbacks of different methods
- Interpret an **Information Flow Diagram**
- Justify the suitability of a representation method for a given context

!!! tip "Exam tip"
    Questions may require judgement about representation methods. Responses should weigh benefits and drawbacks and justify suitability in relation to clarity, structure and effectiveness for representing decomposition.
