# 1.2 Algorithmic Design

## Overview
**Algorithmic design** is the process of creating a clear, logical sequence of steps to solve a problem or complete a task. Algorithms must be **correct, unambiguous, and efficient**.

Algorithms can be represented in different ways and should be understandable by both humans and computers.

---

## 1.2.1 What an Algorithm Is
An **algorithm** is:
- A finite set of step-by-step instructions
- Designed to solve a specific problem
- Executed in a logical order

Algorithms must:
- Have a clear start and end
- Produce a predictable output for a given input

---

## 1.2.2 Algorithm Representation Methods
Algorithms can be expressed using:
- **Flowcharts**
- **Written descriptions**
- **Code** (Python)

Each representation has strengths and limitations.

---

## 1.2.3 Using Programming Constructs in Algorithms
Algorithms may include the following constructs:

- **Sequence** – instructions executed in order
- **Selection** – decisions (e.g. if / else)
- **Iteration** – repetition (loops)

You must be able to:
- Identify these constructs
- Understand how they affect algorithm flow

---

## 1.2.4 Purpose of an Algorithm
You should be able to:
- Explain what a given algorithm is designed to do
- Describe how it works step by step
- Link inputs to expected outputs

This applies to all representations.

---

## 1.2.5 Determining Algorithm Output
You must be able to:
- Trace an algorithm
- Follow each step logically
- Determine the final output for given input values

This may include:
- Multiple iterations
- Nested selection
- Variable updates

---

## 1.2.6 Identifying and Correcting Errors
Algorithms may contain errors such as:
- Incorrect logic
- Missing steps
- Wrong conditions
- Incorrect sequence

You must be able to:
- Identify errors
- Explain why the algorithm is incorrect
- Suggest or apply corrections

---

## 1.2.7 Benefits and Drawbacks of Representations

### Flowcharts
**Benefits**
- Visual and easy to follow
- Good for understanding logic flow

**Drawbacks**
- Can become complex for large problems
- Less precise than code

---

### Written Descriptions
**Benefits**
- Accessible to non-technical audiences
- Good for explaining intent

**Drawbacks**
- Can be ambiguous
- Not executable

---

### Code
**Benefits**
- Precise and unambiguous
- Directly executable

**Drawbacks**
- Requires programming knowledge
- Less accessible to non-technical users

---

## 1.2.8 Choosing a Suitable Representation
The choice of representation depends on:
- Audience (technical vs non-technical)
- Stage of development (planning vs implementation)
- Complexity of the problem

---

## 1.2.9–1.2.10 Errors in Algorithms
Common algorithm errors include:
- Logic errors
- Incorrect conditions
- Infinite loops
- Incorrect variable updates

You should be able to:
- Spot these errors
- Explain their impact on outputs

---

## 1.2.11 Translating Between Representations
You must be able to:
- Convert a flowchart into code
- Convert a written description into a flowchart or code
- Explain how meaning is preserved during translation

---

## Exam Focus
You should be able to:
- Define an algorithm
- Recognise and use sequence, selection, and iteration
- Trace algorithms to find outputs
- Identify and correct errors
- Compare representation methods
- Justify the choice of representation
