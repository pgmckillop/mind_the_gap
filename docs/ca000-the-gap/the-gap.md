# THE ISSUE

The T-Level digital specification changed at the start pf the 25-26 Academic year.

For the older specification, Digital Production Design and Development, we were supported by 2 published resources:

- The textbook
- The revision book

Much of the content of these resources is still valid and very useful. They are available to you in the pages of the T-Level Canvas VLE site.

The content of this resource site will support you where content has been added or changed significantly with the launch of the new qualification:
