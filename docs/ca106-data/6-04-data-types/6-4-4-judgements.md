## 6.4.4 Judging the suitability of structured data, unstructured data, data types and data transformation

### Making judgements

Being able to make judgements involves selecting the **most appropriate combination** of data structure, data type and transformation method for a given digital software development context.

Judgements should consider the following:

i. **Suitability of structured data**  
- Structured data is suitable where data must be:
  - consistently organised
  - easily searched, filtered or analysed
- It supports accuracy, validation and efficient processing when data types are clearly defined.

ii. **Suitability of unstructured data**  
- Unstructured data is suitable where data:
  - varies in format or size
  - does not fit predefined fields
- It provides flexibility but often requires transformation before analysis or integration.

iii. **Suitability of data types**  
- Data types must match the nature of the data:
  - numeric types for calculations
  - textual types for descriptive information
  - Boolean types for logical decisions
- Appropriate data types improve accuracy, efficiency and reliability.

iv. **Suitability of data transformation**  
- Data transformation is suitable where data must be:
  - converted into a usable format
  - cleaned, processed or analysed
- Transformations must preserve data integrity and use appropriate data types.

Effective digital software development requires balancing:
- structure versus flexibility
- efficiency versus complexity
- accuracy versus processing cost

Judgements are made by evaluating how well the chosen data structures, types and transformations meet the requirements of the solution.

!!! tip "Exam tip"
In judgement questions, always **justify your choice**. Examiners expect you to explain *why* a particular data structure, data type or transformation is suitable for the context given, not simply to state which one is used.
