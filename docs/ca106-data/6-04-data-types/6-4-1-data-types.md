## 6.4.1 Common data types

### Definition, purpose and usage

**Common data types** define the kind of values that can be stored, processed and transformed within digital software development. Each data type has a specific purpose and is used according to the nature of the data being handled.

### Integer
- **Definition**: Whole numbers with no fractional part.
- **Purpose**: To represent countable values.
- **When used**: Where values must be exact and discrete, such as counters or quantities.

### Real
- **Definition**: Numbers that can include a fractional (decimal) part.
- **Purpose**: To represent continuous numerical values.
- **When used**: Where precision is required for measurements or calculations involving decimals.

### Character
- **Definition**: A single symbol.
- **Purpose**: To represent individual textual elements.
- **When used**: Where single letters, digits or symbols are required.

### String
- **Definition**: A sequence of characters.
- **Purpose**: To represent text-based data.
- **When used**: For names, messages, identifiers and other textual information.

### Boolean
- **Definition**: A data type with two possible values.
- **Purpose**: To represent logical states.
- **When used**: In decision-making, conditions and control of program flow.

### Date
- **Definition**: A value representing a specific point in time.
- **Purpose**: To store and process temporal information.
- **When used**: For recording, comparing or analysing dates.

### Blob
- **Definition**: Binary Large Object used to store binary data.
- **Purpose**: To store non-textual, unstructured data.
- **When used**: For files such as images, audio or video data.


!!! tip "Exam tip"
In exam questions, focus on **matching the data type to the nature of the data**. Marks are awarded for explaining *why* a data type is suitable (for example, why a **real** is needed instead of an **integer**, or why a **Boolean** is appropriate for decision-making), not just for naming the data type.
