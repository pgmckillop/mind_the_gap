## 6.4.3 Interrelationships between data type and data transformation

### Interrelationships

**Data types** determine how data can be **transformed**, processed and manipulated within digital software development.

Data transformation is constrained and enabled by data type because:
- operations that can be applied to data depend on its type
- some transformations require data to be converted to a different type before processing
- incorrect data types can prevent transformation or lead to errors.

The relationship includes:

i. **Type-dependent operations**  
- Numeric data types allow mathematical transformations.
- Text-based data types allow formatting, parsing or concatenation.
- Boolean data types allow logical evaluation.

ii. **Type conversion during transformation**  
- Data may need to be converted from one type to another to enable transformation.
- Transformation often involves changing raw input into a type suitable for processing.

iii. **Accuracy and validity of transformation**  
- Correct data types ensure transformations produce valid and meaningful results.
- Inappropriate data types can result in loss of precision, incorrect outputs or failed processing.

iv. **Transformation of unstructured data**  
- Unstructured data often requires transformation into structured forms.
- This involves assigning suitable data types to extracted elements.

Data type selection therefore directly impacts the **effectiveness, reliability and suitability** of data transformation in digital software development.

For full marks, explain **why a transformation depends on data type**, not just that transformation occurs. Examiners reward answers that show how *changing or selecting a data type enables a specific transformation*.
