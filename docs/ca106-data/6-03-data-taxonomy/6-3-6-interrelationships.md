## 6.3.6 Interrelationships

Students must understand **how elements within data taxonomy are related** and **how choices in one area affect others** when working with data in digital software development.

### Interrelationships within Data Taxonomy
Data taxonomy classifications are **not isolated**. They influence and constrain each other, including relationships between:
- the **nature of the data**
- how the data is **classified**
- how the data can be **processed, stored, and used**

Changes in one classification may require changes in others to ensure data remains suitable for its intended purpose.

### Impact on Data Handling
Understanding interrelationships helps developers to:
- select appropriate methods for **data collection and processing**
- choose suitable **storage and representation**
- ensure data is **fit for purpose** within a given context

Incorrect assumptions about how data classifications relate can lead to:
- inefficient processing
- loss of meaning
- inappropriate use of data

### Making Judgements
Students must be able to **make judgements about suitability** by considering:
- whether data classifications align with intended use
- how transformations or processing may alter the nature of the data
- whether the chosen taxonomy supports accurate interpretation and decision-making

Judgements should be based on:
- the **context of use**
- the **requirements of the software solution**
- the **characteristics of the data**

### Exam Focus
You should be able to:
- Explain how different elements of data taxonomy are connected
- Describe how one classification decision affects others
- Make justified judgements about the suitability of data classifications in context

!!! tip "Exam tip"
Marks are awarded for **explaining relationships and consequences**, not for listing taxonomy terms in isolation.
