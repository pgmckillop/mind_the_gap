## 6.3.4 Representation of quantitative data

---

## Definition and Purpose
Quantitative data can be represented in different ways depending on how values are measured or categorised.  
Understanding these representations supports correct data storage, processing, and analysis.

---

## Discrete Values
- Represent **countable values**
- Values are distinct and separate
- No values exist between data points

**Used when:**
- counting items
- recording events
- storing whole-number quantities

---

## Continuous Values
- Represent **measurable values**
- Can take any value within a range
- Includes decimal values

**Used when:**
- measuring temperature
- recording time
- capturing physical measurements

---

## Categorical Values
- Represent **labels or groups** within quantitative data
- Used to classify data into defined categories

**Used when:**
- grouping numerical data
- comparing sets of values
- organising data for analysis

---

## Exam Focus
You should be able to:
- Define discrete, continuous, and categorical values
- Distinguish between the different representations
- Select an appropriate representation for a given scenario

!!! tip "Exam tip"
Marks are often awarded for correctly identifying the **representation of data**, not just stating that it is quantitative.
