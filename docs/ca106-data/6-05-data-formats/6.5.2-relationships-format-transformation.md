## 6.5.2 Interrelationships between data format and data transformation

### Interrelationships and judgements

**Data formats** and **data transformation** are closely linked, as the format in which data is stored or exchanged directly affects how it can be transformed and used in digital software development.

The interrelationship includes:

i. **Format constraints on transformation**  
- The structure of a data format determines which transformations are possible.
- Structured formats support predictable and automated transformation.
- Less structured formats require additional processing before transformation.

ii. **Transformation between data formats**  
- Data is often transformed from one format to another to meet system or user requirements.
- Transformation may involve re-structuring, re-encoding or re-organising data.

iii. **Impact of encoding formats**  
- Character encoding formats affect how text data is interpreted during transformation.
- Incorrect encoding can result in data corruption or loss during transformation.

iv. **Suitability of formats for transformation**  
- Some formats are more suitable for frequent transformation due to their structure and consistency.
- Others prioritise simplicity or compatibility over ease of transformation.

### Making judgements about suitability

Judgements about data formats should consider:
- the complexity of the data
- the need for structure and validation
- the frequency and type of transformation required
- compatibility with other systems.

Selecting an appropriate data format ensures efficient, accurate and reliable data transformation in digital software development.

!!! tip "Exam tip"
For judgement questions, explicitly compare **at least two data formats** and explain *why one is more suitable than the other* for the given transformation task. Examiners reward clear, reasoned justification.
