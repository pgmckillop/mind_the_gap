### Definition, purpose and usage

**Data formats** define how data is structured, encoded and stored so that it can be read, transferred and processed by digital systems.

### JSON
- **Definition**: A structured, text-based data format using key–value pairs and arrays.
- **Purpose**: To represent structured data in a lightweight, human-readable format.
- **When used**: For data exchange between systems, particularly between applications and web services.

### Text file
- **Definition**: A file that stores data as plain text characters.
- **Purpose**: To store simple, unformatted data.
- **When used**: Where human readability and simplicity are required, such as logs or configuration data.

### CSV
- **Definition**: A text-based format where values are separated by commas.
- **Purpose**: To store structured, tabular data.
- **When used**: For data import and export between systems such as databases and spreadsheets.

### UTF-8
- **Definition**: A character encoding standard that represents text using one to four bytes.
- **Purpose**: To support a wide range of characters and symbols.
- **When used**: Where internationalisation and compatibility across systems are required.

### ASCII

- **Purpose**: To store and transport structured data with self-describing tags.
- **When used**: Where data structure, validation and extensibility are required.

!!! tip "Exam tip"
In exam responses, link each data format to **its structure and typical use case**. Marks are gained for explaining *why* a format is suitable for a situation, not just for naming the format.
