## 6.7.6 Interrelationships between data dimensions, data quality assurance and data maintenance

### Interrelationships and judgements

The **dimensions of data**, **data quality assurance methods** and **factors affecting data maintenance** are interrelated and must be considered together when making decisions in digital software development.

### Interrelationships

i. **Data dimensions and quality assurance**  
- Large **volume** and high **velocity** increase the need for automated quality assurance.
- High **variety** and **variability** increase the risk of inconsistency, requiring stronger validation and verification.
- Low **veracity** requires increased focus on reliability, consistency and integrity.
- **Value** determines the level of quality assurance that is justified.

ii. **Data dimensions and maintenance factors**  
- Increasing **volume** and **velocity** increase time, skill and cost requirements.
- **Variety** increases the complexity of maintenance and the skills required.
- **Variability** increases ongoing maintenance effort.
- **Value** influences how much time and cost are allocated to maintenance.

iii. **Quality assurance and maintenance factors**  
- Validation and verification require time and skilled staff.
- Ensuring integrity and consistency increases processing and storage costs.
- Redundancy improves resilience but increases maintenance overhead.

### Making judgements about suitability

Judgements must balance:
- the dimensions of the data
- the risks to data quality
- the available time, skills and cost.

Maintaining, transforming and quality assuring data is suitable when:
- the value of the data justifies the resources required
- quality assurance methods reduce risk effectively
- maintenance processes remain sustainable.

Effective digital software development requires selecting **appropriate levels of maintenance, transformation and quality assurance**, rather than applying maximum controls in all situations.

!!! tip "Exam tip"
For full marks, explicitly **weigh up trade-offs**. Examiners reward answers that justify *why* certain data is maintained or quality assured more rigorously based on its **value, volume and available resources**.
