## 6.7 Data dimensions and maintenance

### 6.7.1 The six Vs (dimensions) of Big Data

The **six Vs** describe the key dimensions of Big Data and their impact on data handling.

- **Volume**: the quantity of data generated and stored.
- **Variety**: the range of data formats and types.
- **Variability**: the changeability and inconsistency of data over time.
- **Velocity**: the speed at which data is generated, collected and processed.
- **Veracity**: the accuracy, quality and trustworthiness of data.
- **Value**: the usefulness of data for decision-making and outcomes.

These dimensions affect how data is gathered, stored, maintained and processed in digital software development.

!!! tip "Exam tip"
In exam questions, ensure you **link each V to its impact**, not just provide definitions. Marks are awarded for showing understanding of how each dimension affects data handling.

### 6.7.2 Big Data

**Big Data** refers to datasets that are large, complex and generated rapidly.

- It cannot be effectively handled using traditional data processing methods alone.
- It is characterised by **multiple dimensions**, described by the six Vs.

Understanding Big Data requires recognising that its challenges arise from the combined impact of these dimensions.

!!! tip "Exam tip"
Avoid defining Big Data using a single feature. Examiners expect recognition that Big Data is defined by **multiple interacting dimensions**.

### 6.7.3 Impact of the six Vs on data gathering and maintenance

Each dimension affects how data is gathered and maintained:

i. **Volume** impacts:
- storage capacity requirements
- processing resources needed

ii. **Variety** impacts:
- methods of collection
- storage formats and structures

iii. **Variability** impacts:
- consistency of data over time
- maintenance effort required

iv. **Velocity** impacts:
- speed of data ingestion
- frequency of updates and processing

v. **Veracity** impacts:
- need for quality assurance
- trust in data outputs

vi. **Value** impacts:
- decisions about which data to retain
- prioritisation of maintenance activities

These impacts must be managed to ensure data remains usable and meaningful.

!!! tip "Exam tip"
For higher marks, relate **specific dimensions** to **specific maintenance challenges**, rather than describing the six Vs in isolation.

### 6.7.4 Data quality assurance methods

**Data quality assurance methods** ensure data is accurate, reliable and fit for purpose.

- **Validation**:
  - checks data against predefined rules
  - used to prevent incorrect data entry
- **Verification**:
  - checks data against a trusted source
  - used to confirm data accuracy
- **Reliability**:
  - ensures data is dependable over time
  - used where consistent results are required
- **Consistency**:
  - ensures data values do not conflict
  - used across datasets or systems
- **Integrity**:
  - ensures data remains accurate and unaltered
  - used to protect data throughout its lifecycle
- **Redundancy**:
  - duplication of data
  - used to improve availability and resilience

Each method is applied according to the risks and requirements of the data.

!!! tip "Exam tip"
Examiners expect you to **match the method to its purpose**. Simply listing methods without explaining when or why they are used limits marks.

### 6.7.5 Factors affecting data maintenance

Data maintenance is influenced by several factors:

- **Time**:
  - time required to update, check and manage data
- **Skills**:
  - level of expertise needed to maintain data quality
- **Cost**:
  - financial resources required for storage, processing and staff

These factors affect how frequently data can be maintained and the level of quality assurance applied.

!!! tip "Exam tip"
In exam responses, show how **time, skills and cost constrain maintenance decisions**. Marks are gained for explaining trade-offs, not just listing factors.
