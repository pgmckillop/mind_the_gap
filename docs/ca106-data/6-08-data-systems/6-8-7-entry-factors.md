## 6.8.7 Relationship between data entry factors, data quality and error reduction

### Interrelationships and judgements

The **factors that impact data entry** directly affect **data quality** and influence the suitability of methods used to reduce data entry errors in digital software development.

### Relationship between data entry factors and data quality

i. **Time needed to create data entry screens**  
- Limited development time can reduce the use of error-prevention features.
- Well-designed screens improve accuracy and consistency of data.

ii. **Expertise needed to create data entry screens**  
- Higher levels of expertise enable better validation, layout and user guidance.
- Poorly designed interfaces increase the likelihood of user error.

iii. **Time needed to enter data**  
- Longer entry times increase fatigue and error rates.
- Efficient entry methods improve accuracy and reliability.

These factors collectively influence the accuracy, consistency and reliability of data.

### Judgements about the suitability of error reduction methods

Judgements should consider:
- the volume and importance of data being entered
- the risks associated with incorrect data
- the available time, skills and resources.

Methods are more suitable when:
- **validation** is used to prevent incorrect input at source
- **verification** is applied where accuracy is critical
- **drop-down menus** reduce free-text input
- **pre-filled fields** minimise repeated manual entry.

The most suitable approach balances **data quality requirements** against **development and operational constraints**.

!!! tip "Exam tip"
For full marks, justify *why* a particular error-reduction method is suitable by linking it to **data importance, entry volume and available resources**, rather than describing the method alone.
