## 6.8 Data systems

### 6.8.1 Data wrangling

**Data wrangling** is the process of converting raw data into a format that is suitable for use.

- **Purpose**:
  - to improve data quality
  - to prepare data for analysis or processing
- **When used**:
  - when data is incomplete, inconsistent or unstructured
  - before data is analysed, integrated or stored in a data system

Data wrangling ensures data is usable and meaningful.

!!! tip "Exam tip"
In exam answers, link data wrangling to **preparation and usability**. Marks are awarded for explaining *why data must be wrangled before use*.

### 6.8.2 Steps of data wrangling

Each step has a specific purpose:

- **Structure**:
  - organises data into a defined format
- **Clean**:
  - removes or corrects incorrect, incomplete or duplicate data
- **Validate**:
  - checks data against rules to ensure accuracy and correctness
- **Enrich**:
  - adds additional data to increase usefulness
- **Output**:
  - produces data in a format ready for use or storage

These steps improve data quality and usability.

!!! tip "Exam tip"
Examiners expect you to explain the **purpose of each step**, not just list them. Brief cause-and-effect explanations gain higher marks.

### 6.8.3 Core functions of a data system

A **data system** performs the following core functions:

- **Input**:
  - captures data into the system
- **Search**:
  - locates specific data efficiently
- **Save**:
  - stores data for future use
- **Integrate**:
  - combines data from multiple sources
- **Organise (index)**:
  - structures data to improve retrieval speed
- **Output**:
  - presents data to users or other systems
- **Feedback loop**:
  - uses output results to influence future inputs or processes

These functions support effective data handling.

!!! tip "Exam tip"
For higher marks, show how **functions work together** rather than describing them in isolation.

### 6.8.4 Types of data entry errors

**Data entry errors** occur when incorrect data is entered into a system.

- **Transcription errors**:
  - occur when data is entered incorrectly from a source
- **Transposition errors**:
  - occur when characters or digits are entered in the wrong order

These errors reduce data accuracy and reliability.

!!! tip "Exam tip"
In exams, clearly distinguish between **copying data incorrectly** and **reversing the order of data** to avoid losing marks.

---

### 6.8.5 Methods to avoid data entry errors

Methods to reduce errors include:

- **Validation of user input**:
  - prevents incorrect data entry
- **Verification by double entry**:
  - compares two entries for accuracy
- **Drop-down menus**:
  - limit user input to predefined options
- **Pre-filled data entry boxes**:
  - reduce manual input

These methods improve data quality at the point of entry.

!!! tip "Exam tip"
Examiners reward answers that explain *how* each method reduces errors, not just that it exists.

---

### 6.8.6 Factors impacting data entry

Data entry is affected by:

- **Time needed to create screens**:
  - impacts system development effort
- **Expertise needed to create screens**:
  - affects design quality and error prevention
- **Time needed to enter the data**:
  - affects efficiency and accuracy

These factors influence design decisions in data systems.

!!! tip "Exam tip"
Link each factor to **accuracy and efficiency**. Marks are awarded for explaining trade-offs, not just listing factors.
