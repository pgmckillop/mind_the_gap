## 6.8.8 Relationship between data entry implementation factors and suitability

### Interrelationships and judgements

The **implementation of data entry** in digital software development is influenced by several interrelated factors that affect its suitability.

### Relationship between implementation factors

i. **Time required to implement data entry**  
- Implementing data entry requires time to design, develop and test input screens.
- Limited time may reduce the complexity or robustness of data entry solutions.

ii. **Expertise required for implementation**  
- Skilled developers are needed to design effective data entry mechanisms.
- Lack of expertise increases the risk of poor usability and higher error rates.

iii. **Ongoing effort required**  
- Data entry solutions require maintenance as requirements change.
- Ongoing effort impacts long-term feasibility.

These factors influence whether implementing data entry is practical and sustainable.

### Judgements about suitability

Judgements should consider:
- the necessity of capturing data manually
- the volume and frequency of data entry
- the impact of incorrect or incomplete data
- the available time, skills and resources.

Implementing data entry is suitable when:
- accurate data is essential to system operation
- automated data capture is not feasible
- the benefits of collecting data outweigh implementation and maintenance costs.

In some cases, alternative methods of data collection may be more appropriate.

!!! tip "Exam tip"
Examiners expect you to **weigh benefits against constraints**. Marks are gained for explaining *why implementing data entry is suitable or unsuitable* based on time, expertise and long-term impact.
