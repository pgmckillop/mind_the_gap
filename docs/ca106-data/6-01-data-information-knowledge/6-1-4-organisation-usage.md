## 6.1.4 Use of data and information by organisations

### How organisations use data and information

Organisations use data and information to support decision-making, monitor operations and identify risks and opportunities.

- **Analysis to identify patterns**:
  - Data is analysed to identify trends, relationships and recurring behaviours.
  - This supports informed planning and operational decisions.

- **System performance analysis**:
  - **Load**: data is used to measure demand on systems.
  - **Outage**: data is used to identify periods of system unavailability.
  - **Throughput**: data is used to measure the rate at which work is processed.
  - **Status**: data is used to monitor current system conditions.

- **User monitoring**:
  - **Login/logout** data is used to track system access.
  - **Resources accessed** data is used to monitor usage patterns and behaviour.

- **Targeted marketing**:
  - **Discounts** are informed by analysis of customer behaviour.
  - **Upselling** is supported by identifying purchasing patterns and preferences.

- **Threat and opportunity assessment**:
  - **Competitors**: data is used to assess market position.
  - **Security**: data is used to identify risks and potential breaches.
  - **Compliance**: data is used to ensure adherence to regulations and standards.

These uses enable organisations to improve efficiency, security and strategic decision-making.

For higher marks, explicitly link **each use of data** to its **organisational purpose**. Examiners reward answers that show *how data supports decisions or monitoring*, not just lists of uses.
