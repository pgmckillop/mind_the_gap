## 6.1.5 Judging the suitability of data and its generation

---

## Definition and Purpose
Different types of data and methods of data generation are **not equally suitable** for all digital software development tasks.  
Understanding the relationships between data, information, and how data is generated supports **informed judgements** about suitability.

---

## Relationship Between Data, Information and Generation
- Data is generated from specific sources
- Generated data is processed into information
- Information is interpreted to form knowledge
- Each stage is affected by **how the data is generated**

Poor data generation limits the usefulness of resulting information and knowledge.

---

## Suitability of Data
- Data must be **appropriate for its intended purpose**
- Suitability depends on:
  - accuracy
  - relevance
  - completeness
  - reliability

Unsuitable data can lead to incorrect conclusions or decisions.

---

## Suitability of Data Generation Methods
- Different generation methods produce data with different characteristics
- Some methods introduce greater risk of:
  - bias
  - error
  - inconsistency

The method used must match the **requirements of the system or analysis**.

---

## Making Judgements in Digital Software Development
- Judgements are made by considering:
  - the type of data required
  - how the data is generated
  - how the data will be processed and used
- Suitable choices improve reliability and effectiveness
- Unsuitable choices increase risk and reduce value

---

## Exam Focus
You should be able to:
- Explain how data generation affects data quality
- Link data, information, and generation methods
- Make justified judgements about data suitability

!!! tip "Exam tip"
Higher-mark responses explain **why a data source or method is suitable or unsuitable**, not just what it is.
