## 6.1.2 Sources for generating data

---

## Definition and Purpose
Data can be generated from a range of sources in digital software development.  
Understanding data sources helps ensure that collected data is **appropriate, reliable, and suitable** for its intended use.

---

## Human Sources
- Data generated directly by people
- Often collected through intentional input

**Examples include:**
- surveys
- forms

**Considerations:**
- data accuracy depends on user honesty and understanding
- may be affected by bias or incomplete responses

---

## Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
- Data generated or processed by AI or machine learning systems
- May be used to identify patterns or make predictions

**Key consideration:**
- risk of **feedback loops**, where outputs influence future inputs and reinforce bias

---

## Sensors
- Devices that automatically collect data from the physical environment

**Examples include:**
- temperature
- accelerometer
- vibration
- sound
- light
- pressure

**Characteristics:**
- continuous or high-frequency data generation
- reduced human input

---

## Internet of Things (IoT)
- Networked smart objects that collect and share data automatically

**Examples include:**
- thermostats
- lights
- security cameras
- trackers

**Characteristics:**
- real-time or near real-time data
- often integrated with other systems

---

## Transactional Sources
- Data generated as a result of user or system activity

**Examples include:**
- customer data
- membership records
- timing data
- basket or purchase data

**Characteristics:**
- structured and repeatable
- often stored in databases

---

## Exam Focus
You should be able to:
- Identify different sources of data
- Explain how data is generated by each source
- Recognise risks and limitations associated with different data sources

!!! tip "Exam tip"
Questions may focus on **selecting an appropriate data source** for a given scenario and explaining why it is suitable.
