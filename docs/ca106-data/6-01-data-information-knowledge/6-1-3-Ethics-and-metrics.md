## 6.1.3 Ethical data practices and data value

---

## Definition and Purpose
Ethical data practices ensure that data is collected, used, and managed **responsibly and appropriately**.  
The value of data is determined using specific **metrics** that indicate how useful the data is for its intended purpose.

---

## Ethical Data Practices
- Ethical data practices focus on **responsible handling of data**
- They aim to reduce harm, bias, and misuse
- Ethical considerations apply throughout the data lifecycle

**Key principles include:**
- collecting data for a clear purpose
- avoiding misuse or misrepresentation of data
- considering the impact of data use on individuals and organisations

## Metrics to Determine the Value of Data

### Quantity
- Refers to the **amount of data collected**
- Larger quantities may improve reliability and analysis
- Excessive data may increase storage and processing costs

---

### Timeframe
- Refers to the **period over which data is collected**
- Data may lose value if it becomes outdated
- Appropriate timeframes depend on the intended use of the data

---

### Source
- Refers to **where the data originates**
- Trusted and appropriate sources increase data value
- Poor or biased sources reduce usefulness

---

### Veracity
- Refers to the **accuracy and truthfulness** of data
- Low veracity reduces confidence in outcomes
- Errors, bias, or manipulation reduce data quality

---

## Relationship Between Ethics and Data Value
- Ethical data practices support higher data value
- Poor ethical practices reduce trust, reliability, and usefulness
- Data that lacks integrity or fairness is less suitable for decision-making

## Exam Focus
You should be able to:
- Explain what ethical data practices are
- Identify metrics used to determine the value of data
- Explain how ethical practices affect data value

!!! tip "Exam tip"
Marks are often awarded for linking **ethical handling** of data to its **usefulness and reliability**, not just listing metrics.
