## 6.2.1 Methods of transforming data

---

## Definition and Purpose
Data transformation refers to the ways in which data is **changed or worked on** so that it can be used effectively in digital software development.  
Different transformation methods support different outcomes, such as preparing data for analysis or producing meaningful outputs.

---

## Manipulating Data
- **Manipulating** data involves changing its structure or format
- Focuses on organising or restructuring data

**Examples include:**
- sorting data
- filtering data
- combining data sets
- reformatting values

**Purpose:**
- prepare data for further use
- improve usability and consistency

---

## Analysing Data
- **Analysing** data involves examining data to identify **patterns, trends, or relationships**
- Focuses on gaining insight rather than altering structure

**Purpose:**
- support decision-making
- identify opportunities or issues
- inform conclusions

---

## Processing Data
- **Processing** data involves performing operations on data to produce results
- Often automated and repeatable

**Examples include:**
- calculations
- aggregations
- applying rules or logic

**Purpose:**
- convert data into meaningful outputs
- support system functionality

---

## Relationship Between Transformation Methods
- Manipulation, analysis, and processing may be used together
- The chosen method depends on:
  - the type of data
  - the intended outcome
- Inappropriate transformation reduces data value

---

## Exam Focus
You should be able to:
- Define each method of data transformation
- Distinguish between manipulating, analysing, and processing data
- Identify appropriate transformation methods for a given purpose
